# twitter_weather_bot
A Twitter Bot developed in Python to inform the current weather forecast in my city.

This Bot was developed to, when mentioned on twitter, inform the current weather forecast in Florianopolis, Brazil.
I used the 'tweepy' library to easily access the Twitter API and also the 'pyowm' library to access the OpenWeatherMap API so I could get the weather data.
The bot is currently working, you can mention @FloripaTempoBot on twitter whenever you want to check it out.
